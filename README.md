# amharic-telegram-ecommerce-entity-extraction
This project builds a real-time system to extract product names, prices, and locations from Amharic e-commerce Telegram channels. Using fine-tuned LLMs for Named Entity Recognition (NER), the extracted data will populate EthioMartâ€™s centralized platform, simplifying e-commerce in Ethiopia by consolidating various channels into one hub.
